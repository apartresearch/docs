### Consistency

Even though one might find it inappropriate to value quantity over quality, a main part of Apart Research's communication strategy rests on the deliverance of information. We believe that a consistent information flow is far more valuable than inconsistently delivered high-quality communication.

Apart are active distributors on information platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn etc., and we aim to deliver** weekly content** on each of these. Apart also has a weekly newsletter, a grand newsletter once a month and sporadic updates on our Discord-server[^1].
