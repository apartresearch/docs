### Audience directed

Apart is an actor in different spheres where different communication is needed. Therefore, the communication team always considers the most appropriate channel for delivering new content.

For the moment being Apart aim to communicate on three different levels:

1. (Karl Friston): Dense information aiming to address the EA and AIS community.
2. (Carl Sagan): Semi-dense information aiming to address a more broad academic publicity.
3. (BBC): Direct thin information aiming to address a very broad publicity. Awareness on AI safety is the main goal here.

#### Level 1 - Karl Friston

The first information level's main goal is to align agendas in the AIS-community and to aid cooperation between researchers in the field.

Knowledge on agendas, researchers and a fairly developed vocabulary is assumed

Current channels: YouTube (The AI Safety Progress Report), Our own articles on LessWrong and EA-Forum, Sharing of this content on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook

Wishlist: Publishing research articles in journals and conference proceedings, create a research dashboard for the state of AI safety.

#### Level 2 - Carl Sagan

The second information level's main goal is to address other academic fields on the work of AIS. This includes but aren't limited to: Medicine, Psychology, Law etc

It is assumed that the receivers have no prior knowledge on agendas or the names of researchers. No vocabulary is assumed, but the content is explained in academic terms with more dense information.

Channels: Sharing of content on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.

Wishlist: Social media videos introducing simpler concepts in AI safety for a broader audience, lectures at non-AI safety conferences, political conventions, AI governance, Medium.

#### Level 3 - BBC

The third information level's main goal is to address the broad public on the risks of TAI-development (possibly through AGI). No prior knowledge on the field is assumed and the information density is low to make it accessible to the widest group of receivers. The information will have an action-based focus despite its alarm-calling context.

Channels: No current channels for this type of communication

Wishlist: Danish media (Zetland, DR, TV 2), international media, audio, video, and text, podcast.
