### Knowledge sharing before information restriction

As stated by Nick Bostr√∂m, a risk lies in competition for AGI-development. Apart believes that knowledge sharing is more important than information restrictions, when it comes to the development of safe AI.

With this said, Apart have also put a set of values for responsible information sharing with the aim to avoid the spread of untrue information, contributing to non constructive alarming information that may raise unnecessary panic and addressing the right audience. For now the responsible information sharing rests on the common sense of Apart's employees and the considerations listed below

1. Is there a risk that this information might be wrongful and what potential consequences will this have?
2. Is the tone of this information alarming and thus have the risk of raising unnecessary panic?
3. Is this information appropriate for the audience? \

Apart knows that this may result in possible information hazards, but we believe this to be better than risking misunderstandings that may accelerate the development of AGI unnecessarily.
