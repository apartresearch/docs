### Offices

When someone is onboarded, we provide $50 per expected average week hours (e.g. someone working 15 hours a week gets $750) for setting up their home office, hardware, and whatever is needed to be productive. Research freelancers do not receive this amount.

When the London offices are set up and ready, everyone can work there. Any full-time-employees will be based in London.
