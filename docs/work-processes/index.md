## Work Processes

Apart Research works internally with a culture of **compassionate pragmatism**.

This means we ensure a safe work-life balance while maintaining the importance of the mission we are working towards. It means that when someone is performing poorly, we do not fire them, but we help them become better through learning, sparring, and discussion.

We approach our work with respect for ensuring that all messages come across well, that our work is good and true, that we save humanityâ€™s potential, that everyone understands and agrees with the mission, and that we exist within the community and the world we inhabit.
