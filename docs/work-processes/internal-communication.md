### Internal communication channels

We work through Discord in publicly closed and open channels. By default, core and communication work is closed while research work is open. This incentivizes community members to join the research.

When the team travels across many time zones, a strong project management through HacknPlan is invaluable for asynchronous work. We conduct an hourly call once a week and this meeting is rescheduled if someone cannot join.
Other communication channels used in Apart are Google Meet[^1] (for formal meetings) and GatherTown[^2].
